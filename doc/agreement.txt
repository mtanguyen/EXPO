Section 1. Per Share Amount Increased. The second Recital to the Agreement shall be amended and restated as follows:
"WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent has agreed to 
cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value 
$0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") (which shares of the Company Common Stock are hereinafter referred to as the 
"Shares"), at a price per Share of $173.00, provided that if at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on April 8, 2015 (which is one minute after 
11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 7, 2015) all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set 
forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied, or waived by Merger Sub, then the price per Share shall be reduced to $158.00 per Share (such 
amount or any different amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Offer 
Price"), in each case payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;"

Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on April 1, 2015 (which is one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on 
March 31, 2015) (the "Initial Expiration Date") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the 
date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been 
extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). If on any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the 
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied, or waived by 
Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to ten Business Days each, 
the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; 
provided, however, that (i) with respect to the extension, if any, immediately following the Initial Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall (and 
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer to 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on April 8, 2015 (which is one minute after 11:59 p.m., 
Eastern Time, on April 7, 2015) and (ii) Merger Sub shall not be required to, and shall not without the Company's prior written consent, 
extend the Offer beyond May 1, 2015 (the "Outside Date"). In addition, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required 
by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")

requirements of the Exchange Act. Within one Business Day after the date of this Amendment, the Company shall file with the SEC and mail to 
the Company's stockholders an amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 describing the recommendation of the Company Board giving effect to this 
Amendment, and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company's stockholders as required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange

the Company's existing rights and obligations under the Agreement, the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any 
activities, discussion or negotiation with Endo or any other Person conducted heretofore by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any 
Company Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal received prior to the execution of this Amendment.

advisable in connection with any such equity financing, and Sections 5.2(d) and (e) of the Agreement shall apply to this Section 5 mutatis 
mutandis; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have received the Required Information.
